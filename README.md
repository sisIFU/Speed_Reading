*"If we come to think reading is this secondary activity we do while doing other stuff, then we lose that deepest and most important kind of reading," said Nicholas Carr, author of 'The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains.' "The broader danger is that technology will give us the illusion that everything can be done while multitasking, including reading."*

### Conclusion

*What differentiates fast and slow readers is not how they read, he points out, but their overall language skills and vocabularies.*

In conclusion, speed reading is worthwhile when you need to read something unimportant or want to get the gist of something. You will sacrfice your comprehension for the speed. In a word, *you can not be a fast reading comprehension machine*. But is there any way to improve your reading speed? The answer is **to read faster, you should read more.** Check this article and get a detailed looked at the answer:[Faster Pussycat! Read! Read!](http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/articles/2000/02/faster_pussycat_read_read.html).

*The real worry is that if people wind up reading in a less rewarding fashion, they'll get fewer rewards from reading â€” and then books will become less an object of passionate love and more of a momentary distraction, after all.*
